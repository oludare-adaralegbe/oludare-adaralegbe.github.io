### The Challenge
The Head of Marketing needs a data-driven approach to identify the most impactful UK YouTubers for their 2024 marketing campaigns. These collaborations will be crucial for reaching the right audience and maximizing campaign impact.

### The Solution
By using publicly available data (including YouTube Data API and Kaggle datasets) a dashboard focusing on UK YouTubers in 2024 can be created. This dashboard will display crucial metrics like:
- **Subscriber Count**: Shows the established audience base of each YouTuber.
- **Total Views**: Indicates the overall content reach and potential viewership for marketing campaigns.
- **Total Videos**: Provides context on content creation frequency and potential campaign integration opportunities.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Goes beyond basic viewership and delves into audience interaction, a crucial factor for successful campaigns.
- **Target Audience**: Identify YouTubers whose audience aligns with target demographic maximizing campaign effectiveness.
- **Channel Category**: Identify YouTubers who align with your brand's style and target audience.

### The Benefit
This data-driven approach will equip the marketing team to make strategic decisions about which YouTubers best align with their campaign goals ensuring successful collaborations and maximizing return on investment.

## User Story
As the Head of Marketing, I want a data-driven approach to identify high-performing UK YouTubers. This includes analyzing subscriber count, video uploads, total views, and engagement rate. By understanding these metrics, I can make informed decisions about potential marketing partnerships that will maximize campaign return on investment (ROI).

## Data Source
To identify high-performing UK YouTubers for our 2024 marketing campaigns, we'll use a dataset containing key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Data Acquisition
- Kaggle ([Excel file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download))
- Scrape YouTube data (Python script)
- Researched data

### Data Elements
- Channel Name
- Subscriber Count
- Total Views
- Total Videos Uploaded
- Engagement Metrics
- Channel Category
- Target Audience

## Phases
1. Design
2. Development & Implementation
3. Quality Assurance
4. Analysis

## Design

### Dashboard Questions
The following questions will guide the dashboard's content:
- **Top Performers**: 
  - Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?
  - Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?
  - Which 3 channels have the most total views?
  - Which 3 channels have the highest engagement rate?
- **Engagement & Efficiency**: 
  - Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?
  - Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?
- **Additional Questions**: 
  - Is there a specific target audience demographic for the marketing campaigns?
  - What content do these YouTubers typically create (e.g., gaming, comedy, news)?

### Dashboard Components/Mockup
The dashboard will consist of several visual elements to answer the questions listed above:
- **Top Performers Section**: 
  - **Table**: Display all the YouTubers with their respective subscriber counts, video uploads, total views, likes, comments, and channel category.
  - **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Visually represent the top 10 YouTubers and their subscriber counts, total views, likes, and comments.
- **Engagement & Efficiency Section**: 
  - **Scorecards**: Showcase key metrics like average views per video, views per subscriber ratio, likes per view, and comments per view for the channels.
- **Additional Considerations**:
  - **Filtering Options**: Allow users to filter data by target audience to enhance exploration.
  - **Visual Appeal**: Maintain a clean and consistent design aesthetic to keep the dashboard visually appealing and user-friendly.

![Dashboard-Mockup](assets/images/dashboard_mockup.png)

### Tools
The project will likely utilize a combination of the following tools:
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and evaluation of the channels for product placement.
- **SQL Server**: For data cleaning, data quality tests, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: Primary tool for creating interactive visualizations and the final dashboard.
- **GitHub**: Hosting project documentation, code, and version control.
- **Mokkup AI**: Designing a wireframe/mockup for the dashboard layout.

## Development
### Data Analysis Pipeline
**Input**: Raw data

**Output**: Data visualisation and insights report

**Steps**:
1. Download the data from Kaggle.
2. Perform initial data exploration to understand its structure.
3. Import data into SQL Server.
4. Clean and transform the data using SQL queries in SQL Server to make sure it is accurate and complete. This may involve casting data types and addressing inconsistencies.
5. Test the cleaned data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
6. Import the cleaned data into Power BI for visualisation.
7. Create DAX measures to calculate additional metrics relevant for analysis.
8. Build interactive data visualisations within Power BI to create an informative dashboard.
9. Analyse the data to identify key insights.
10. Provide recommendations for potential YouTube channels to partner with.

### Initial Data Observations
The initial exploration in Excel reveals several key observations:
- **Data Completeness**: The data looks to have enough columns (at least 9) for our analysis, reducing the need for further information from the client.
- **Channel Identification**: The first column includes channel IDs separated by a "@" sign. We'll need to extract the channel names from this data.
- **Multilingual Considerations**: Some cells and headers are in another language. Identifying their relevance and resolving any language barriers will be crucial.
- **Data Streamlining**: The data includes more information than this project requires. We will need to identify and remove unnecessary columns to improve the analysis.

### Data Cleaning
Here's how the raw data will be transformed into a well-structured format:

#### Desired Outcome
- **Column Selection**: Only the key columns necessary for the analysis will be kept.
- **Data Type Validation**: Each column's data type will appropriately reflect its content (VARCHAR for channel names, INTEGER for numerical values).
- **Null Value Elimination**: There will be no null values, ensuring that each record contains complete data.
- **Channel Name Extraction**: The actual channel names will be extracted from the first column using string manipulation functions in SQL.
- **Column Renaming**: For clarity, aliases will be assigned to the columns using appropriate names.

### Final Cleaned Data Schema
- **Number of Rows**: 100 
- **Number of Columns**: 9

| Column Name       | Data Type | Nullable | Description                                      |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| channel_name      | VARCHAR   | NO       | Name of the YouTube channel                      |
| total_subscribers | INTEGER   | NO       | Total number of subscribers for the channel      |
| total_views       | INTEGER   | NO       | Total views accumulated by the channel           |
| total_videos      | INTEGER   | NO       | Total number of videos uploaded by the channel   |
| total_likes       | INTEGER   | NO       | Total number of likes generated by the channel   |
| total_comments    | INTEGER   | NO       | Total number of comments generated by the channel|
| channel_category  | VARCHAR   | NO       | The category the channel falls under             |
| target_audience   | VARCHAR   | NO       | The demography of the channelâ€™s audience         |

### Apply Data Transformation

```sql
/*
# DATA PREP STEPS
1. Clean up the Data: remove irrelevant columns by only keeping the ones needed.
2. Grab the Channel Names: extract channel name from 'NOMBRE' column.
*/

SELECT
	SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE) -1) AS channel_name,
	Subscribers,
	Views,
	Total_videos,
	Total_likes,
	Total_comments,
	Channel_category,
	Channel_target_audience

FROM
	top_uk_youtubers_2024
```

### SQL View Creation

```sql
/*
1. Create a view view to include only relevant columns and rows.
2. Ensure the channel name is of type VARCHAR(100)
3. Select only the necessary columns from the original table
*/

-- 1.
CREATE VIEW view_uk_youtubers_2024 AS

-- 2.
SELECT
	CAST(SUBSTRING(NOMBRE, 1, CHARINDEX('@', NOMBRE)-1) AS VARCHAR(100)) AS Channel_name,
	Subscribers,
	Views,
	Total_videos,
	Total_likes,
	Total_comments,
	Channel_category,
	Channel_target_audience

-- 3.
FROM 
	top_uk_youtubers_2024
```

## Data Quality Assurance

### Data Quality Checks
Here are some of the key checks performed:

1. **Row Count Validation**: the total number of records in the dataset must be 100.
2. **Column Count Validation**: the number of columns in the dataset must be 8 fields.
3. **Data Type Validation**: the channel name, channel category, channel target audience columns 
must be string; engagement rate must be float and other numeric fields must be integers.
4. **Uniqueness Validation**: each record must be unique in the dataset.
